Frogger
=======

In the style of the iconic arcade game from years ago, this game is an attempt
to provide gameplay similar to Frogger, originally developed by Konami.

The object of the game is to navigate your player to the top row of the
game board using the arrow keys on your keyboard, all while avoiding
collisions with the enemy bugs crossing the board trying to run you over.

If you succeed, you win. If you collide with an enemy bug, your position is
reset to the bottom of the board and you can try again.

INSTALLATION
============

Copy all files and folders to a directory on your computer. Once copied,
open the index.html file in your normal web browser and the game will
begin automatically. You must have JavaScript enabled in your browser
for the game to work.

GAME PLAY
=========

Move your character around the board using the 4 arrow keys (up, down, left,
right) on your keyboard. You cannot move off the board, and there is no
"wrap" (if you run into a left, right, or bottom border, you will stay there
until you move away from that space).

Using skillful moves, navigate your player to the top "water" row of the board
without being hit by the crossing enemy bugs. If you make it to the top, the
game will proclaim you a winner. After acknowledging your win, the game
automatically resets so you can try again.

When you are done playing, simply close your browser window or navigate to
another website, turn your computer off, or let it play on needlessly
consuming energy if that's what you feel like doing.
